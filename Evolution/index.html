            The 'vehicles' use a physics based engine to move around. The goal for the vehicle is the target in the top.
            The vehicles are programmed to follow a list of instructions (a.k.a their DNA). 
            Vehicles who ended up close to the target 'pass down their genetics' to the next generations, which, supposedly, do better in reaching the target.
